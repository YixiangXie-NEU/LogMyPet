Commenting on Project3 by Lingyi Zheng: I like the idea of the project which is convinent for people who have pets and record pets' daily behaviors. And I love the cute icon you guys made for behaviors like drinking water. The whole design style is clear and easy to follow. And I also like how well structure and organized your folders have and connection between backend and frontend. But i didn't see your released version. Maybe, adding released link in readme will be perfect:)

**Project Objective**: For project 3, we are required to create a full stack application with Node + Express + Mongo as the backend and React with hooks as the frontend. We decided to build a platform that allows the users to create profiles for their pets and to log several behaviors for their pets, such as drinking water, eating food or defecating.
